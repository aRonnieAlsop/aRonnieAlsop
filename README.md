  <li>🏡 Remote Warrior: Living in a remote, small town high in the Sierra Nevadas, I've developed resilience and adaptability. I thrive on challenges and bring a unique perspective to the world of coding.</li>
  <li>🌐 Diverse Experience: With over 20 years in the food industry, starting as a food server in high school, I've honed my interpersonal and communication skills. This experience has shaped me into a reliable team player and effective communicator.</li>
</ul>
